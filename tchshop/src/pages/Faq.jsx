    question: 'Shipping & Packaging Information',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Techshop engagement is to get your orders to you as quickly as possible in perfect condition. All packages are insured to 100% of the value, and Techshop Delivery Protection can be used to ensure immediate re-shipment if a package is lost or damaged.</p>
        <p>All orders are securely packaged. Orders are further protected in an untearable polyurethane satchel, ensuring that your package is not tampered with during delivery.</p>
        <p>To ensure privacy and reduce theft, all packages are anonymous - there is no mention of product contents or Techshop branding on the outside of the packaging.</p>

  {
    question: 'When will my order be dispatched?',
    answer: (
      <>

  },
  {
    question: 'My order has missing / incorrect products.',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Please contact customer support immediately. For your protection, all orders are photographed before leaving the warehouse. In the case of missing or incorrect products, we will compare a photograph of products received vs. products sent. If the warehouse photo confirms the missing or incorrect product, we will immediately replace or refund the error.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'My parcel was opened / damaged.',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Do not accept a shipment that is damaged or opened. Techshop packages are securely prepared in double-wall boxes with an anti-tear shipping satchel. Accidental opening of packages is not possible. If your package is damaged or opened, refuse the parcel.</p>
        <p>If you accept a parcel that has been damaged or opened in transit, Techshop is unable to provide any recourse.</p>

    answer: ( 
      <>
        <p>Payment can be made through Ramp, our trusted payment partner, enabling efficient order processing  with a variety of payment methods. </p>
        <p>We accept USDT (Tether TRC-20) as a payment method, offering a fast and efficient way to process your transactions.
